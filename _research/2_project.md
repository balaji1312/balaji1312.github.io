This work presents preliminary findings in automatically scoring childrenâ€™s oral assessments while they perform a picture
description task. Approximately 200 children aged 9-13 participated in this task in which they tell a story about an image
presented to them. We use a BERT-based system to predict assessment scores from input ASR transcripts of the student responses. Finally, we propose next design steps to make the system more applicable to an educational setting.
