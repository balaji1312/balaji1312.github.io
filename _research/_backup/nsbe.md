This work evaluates the performance of widely-used open-source automatic speech recognition systems in transcribing primarily African American English-speaking children’s speech for educational applications. We investigate the performance of the Whisper, HuBERT, and Wav2Vec2 ASR systems as well as the capability of the transformer-based language model, BERT, for automatically grading the student’s oral responses to assessment prompts through use of the generated ASR transcripts. We achieve a 95% oral response scoring accuracy through the methods described. We also show a thorough analysis of ASR system performance over a diverse set of metrics going beyond the standard word error rate.
