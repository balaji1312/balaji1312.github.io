    abstract = "{This paper describes an original dataset of children's speech, collected through the use of JIBO, a social robot. The dataset encompasses recordings from 110 children, aged 4–7 years old, who participated in a letter and digit identification task and extended oral discourse tasks requiring explanation skills, totaling 21 h of session data. Spanning a 2-year collection period, this dataset contains a longitudinal component with a subset of participants returning for repeat recordings. The dataset, with session recordings and transcriptions, is publicly available, providing researchers with a valuable resource to advance investigations into child language development.}",
