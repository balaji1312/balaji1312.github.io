Hi! I’m a Masters student in the Electrical and Compter Engineering department at the Unicersity of California, Los Angeles. I'm currently affiliated with the Speech Processing and Auditory Preception Laboratory, and working with Prof. Abeer Alwan. I’m primarily interested on the usage of machine learning in speech processing. More concretely, I aim to improve the performance of large scale ML models on low resource domains such as accented and childrens' speech by obtaining better representations for the same.

I completed my undergraduate degree at the National Institue of Technology, Tiruchirappalli in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I primarily worked on enhancing preprocessing techniques for color fundus images to help improve performance on downstream aberration detection and disease classification tasks in the Singal and Image Processing Laboratory under the guidance of Prof. Varun Gopi. I also spent time with the Pattern Recognition and Computational Intelligence Laboratory working on the Vocal and Non-Vocal segmentation of audio with intrumental background noise with Prof. E.S.Gopi.
