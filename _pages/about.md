Hi! I’m a Masters student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of California, Los Angeles. I'm currently affiliated with the Speech Processing and Auditory Preception Laboratory, and working with Prof. Abeer Alwan. Before joining UCLA, I completed my undergraduate degree at the National Institue of Technology, Tiruchirappalli in Electronics and Communication Engineering where I primarily worked on enhancing preprocessing techniques for color fundus images to help improve performance on downstream aberration detection and disease classification tasks in the Signal and Image Processing Laboratory under the guidance of Prof. Varun Gopi.

I’m primarily interested on the usage of machine learning in speech processing. More concretely, I aim to improve the performance of large scale ML models on low resource domains such as accented and childrens' speech. My current research interests lie in obtaining better representations for the low resource domains to imporve existing acoustic models using a combination of transfer learning and domain adaptation.
