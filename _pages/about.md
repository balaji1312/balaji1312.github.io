Hi! I'm a Master's student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of California, Los Angeles. I'm currently affiliated with the Speech Processing and Auditory Perception Laboratory and working with Prof. Abeer Alwan. Before joining UCLA, I completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. During my undergrad, I have also worked in the Signal and Image Processing Laboratory under the guidance of Prof. Varun Gopi on enhancing preprocessing techniques for color fundus images to help improve performance on downstream aberration detection and disease classification tasks. 

I'm primarily interested in the usage of machine learning in speech processing. More concretely, I aim to improve the performance of large-scale ML models on low-resource domains such as accented and children's speech. My current research interests lie in understanding acoustic relationships between representations of speech in deep learning models to create more equitable low-resource ASR models.
