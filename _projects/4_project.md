The goal of this course project was to create a twitter thread generating model. Ideally our model will be able to model a twitter thread conversation between a Seahawks and a Patriots fan using the scraped data provided to us. To perform this tasks we finetune GPT2 with a combination of data from the 6 datasets and benchmark the performance of the finetuned model against zero shot performance of other popular more powerful models from OpenAI specifically GPT3.5 and the models from the GPT3 suite.

We also experimented with fine tuning GPT2 with a analysis of the output generated by GPT2 and compared the outputs of all the models (finetuned GPT2, GPT3 and GPT3.5) along with an explanation for the results coupled with a discussion on which model could be more suited for which cases.
